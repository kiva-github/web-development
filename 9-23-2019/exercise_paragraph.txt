What I found easy from the resources was utilizing different attributes to style specific
elements. I enjoyed working through the exercises and seeing how each change affected the
element in a particular manner. What I found challenging was remembering all of the CSS
attributes, such as the differences between padding, margin, and border settings for the
box elements and the different types of positioning (fixed, absolute, relative, etc.). An
"aha" moment I had was fully understanding the difference between styling in the <style>
tag as opposed to the style attribute or an external CSS styling sheet. Something I learned
that could come in useful for my own website is box-sizing and spacing, because I imagine
I'll be using a lot of divs and I will have to space them appropriately.
